**ALL DONE AT OWN RISK, ESP32 are not officially 5V tolerant, and this may damage your AC Unit**

To connect to the AC I bought these for the CN-CNT port.

They come pre-terminated with dupont sockets, the cable colours are annoying, eg the ground pin is red, but they work.

For the board I went with the reccomended ESP32, after burning out an ESP8266.

I bought one of these to test with:

As it has pre soldered PINS, you can just connect the cable straight to the pins.
